# Cucumber for Elixir

A behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework for Elixir that enables writing executable specifications in natural language. Cucumber for Elixir bridges the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders by allowing tests to be written in plain language while being executed as code.

## Features

- **Auto-discovery**: Automatically finds and runs feature files and step definitions
- **Gherkin Support**: Write tests in familiar Given/When/Then format
- **Parameter Typing**: Define step patterns with typed parameters like `{string}`, `{int}`, `{float}`
- **Data Tables**: Pass structured data to your steps
- **DocStrings**: Include multi-line text blocks in your steps
- **Background Steps**: Define common setup steps for all scenarios
- **Tag Filtering**: Run subsets of scenarios using tags
- **Async Test Execution**: Run feature tests concurrently with the `@async` tag
- **Hooks**: Before/After scenario hooks with tag-based filtering
- **Context Passing**: Share state between steps with a simple context map
- **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Detailed error messages with clickable file:line references, step execution history, and formatted HTML output
- **ExUnit Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Elixir's built-in test framework

## Installation

Add `cucumber` to your `mix.exs` dependencies:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:cucumber, "~> 0.4.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Add Cucumber to your test helper

In your `test/test_helper.exs`:

```elixir
ExUnit.start()
Cucumber.compile_features!()
```

### 2. Create a Feature File

Feature files use the Gherkin syntax and should be placed in `test/features/` with a `.feature` extension:

```gherkin
# test/features/calculator.feature
Feature: Basic Calculator

Scenario: Adding two numbers
  Given I have entered 50 into the calculator
  And I have entered 70 into the calculator
  When I press add
  Then the result should be 120 on the screen
```

### 3. Create Step Definitions

Step definitions should be placed in `test/features/step_definitions/` with a `.exs` extension:

```elixir
# test/features/step_definitions/calculator_steps.exs
defmodule CalculatorSteps do
  use Cucumber.StepDefinition
  import ExUnit.Assertions

  step "I have entered {int} into the calculator", %{args: [value]} = context do
    values = Map.get(context, :values, [])
    Map.put(context, :values, values ++ [value])
  end

  step "I press add", context do
    sum = Enum.sum(context.values)
    Map.put(context, :result, sum)
  end

  step "the result should be {int} on the screen", %{args: [expected]} = context do
    assert context.result == expected
    context
  end
end
```

### 4. Run Your Tests

```bash
# Run all tests including Cucumber
mix test

# Run only Cucumber tests
mix test --only cucumber

# Run specific feature
mix test --only feature_basic_calculator
```

## File Structure

By default, Cucumber expects the following structure:

```
test/
  features/
    authentication.feature
    shopping.feature
    step_definitions/
      authentication_steps.exs
      shopping_steps.exs
      common_steps.exs
```

You can customize paths in `config/test.exs`:

```elixir
config :cucumber,
  features: ["test/features/**/*.feature"],
  steps: ["test/features/step_definitions/**/*.exs"]
```

## Working with Data Tables

In your feature file:
```gherkin
Given I have the following items in my cart:
  | Product Name    | Quantity | Price  |
  | Smartphone      | 1        | 699.99 |
  | Protection Plan | 1        | 79.99  |
```

In your step definitions:
```elixir
step "I have the following items in my cart:", context do
  # Access the datatable
  datatable = context.datatable

  # Access headers
  headers = datatable.headers  # ["Product Name", "Quantity", "Price"]

  # Access rows as maps
  items = datatable.maps
  # [
  #   %{"Product Name" => "Smartphone", "Quantity" => "1", "Price" => "699.99"},
  #   %{"Product Name" => "Protection Plan", "Quantity" => "1", "Price" => "79.99"}
  # ]

  # Process the items
  Map.put(context, :cart_items, items)
end
```

## Async Test Execution

By default, Cucumber tests run synchronously. To enable concurrent execution for features that don't share state, add the `@async` tag:

```gherkin
@async
Feature: Independent Feature

Scenario: Concurrent scenario
  Given some precondition
  When something happens
  Then expect a result
```

Features marked with `@async` will run concurrently with other async tests, improving test suite performance. Only use this tag for features that:
- Don't share state with other tests
- Don't rely on test execution order
- Are truly independent

Note: Database tests can safely run async when using Ecto's SQL sandbox in shared mode.
